This UI is for a user to retrieve SPV BEEF and Envelope(deprecated) formats when they enter their TXID. Currently, BEEF is only available for testnet. To demonstrate the improved efficiency of the BEEF format, the length of each is displayed showing the improved reduction as a percentage.

To reduce the calls to `hashwrap` the results are cached for the page.
